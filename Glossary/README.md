# Glossary
 This is a glossary of terms associated with the design, manufacture, assembly, and test of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and assemblies. The terms in **BOLD** are terms you should look up and become fluent with since they will come up frequently during discussions related to PCBs.
 
 Please let us know if you have a better definition than the one you see here so we can improve the Glossary.

    <summary>Annotation</summary>
    
    noun - the information added to a design that makes refering to things easier
            "I added the Q1 annotation."
    verb - the act of adding information (such as reference designators) to a design
           This can be done via automation or manually. It is often possible to add annotation to either the schematic or the board layout.
           "We annotated all components again to make things sequential."
